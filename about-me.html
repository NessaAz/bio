<body>
    <h2>background</h2>
      <p>I am a firstborn of 5. I went though the 8-4-4 Kenyan education system. These facts alone should give you a glimpse of how principled I am.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I have high school certification, fundamental accounting training, statistics qualification and currently undergoing Software Development training.</p>

    <h2> work experience <em>3-4 years</em> </h2> 
      <p>I've only worked in the finance department for 3 companies over that period </p>
    <h2>Why I chose the programming route</h2>
      <p>After the 3 years in finance, I was daunted by the fact that I could only use my brain for the highly repetitive tasks. I wanted to exercise creative thinking and problem solving; things which I an only do in Tech.</p>
    <h2>Here are some of my interests</h2> 
      <ul>
      <li>Backpacking</li>
      <li>Travelling to hidden waterfalls</li>
      <li>anything that brings out the brainiac in me</li>
      <li>And a lot more</li>
      </ul>
